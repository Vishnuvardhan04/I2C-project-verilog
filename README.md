# I2C Protocol Design in Verilog

## 📌 Description
A Verilog-based implementation of the Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol designed to enable serial communication between master and slave devices on a shared bus.

## ⚙️ Features
- Master-driven communication protocol
- Address matching and acknowledgment mechanism
- Serial data transmission and clock generation
- Simulation-based verification of transactions

## 🧪 Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- ModelSim / QuestaSim

## 🧠 Learnings
- Understanding of I2C communication protocol
- Edge-triggered signal design
- Master-slave coordination in digital circuits
